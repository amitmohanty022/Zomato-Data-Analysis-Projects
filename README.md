# Zomato Data Analysis Project Using Python

## Project Overview
This project performs data analysis on Zomato data using Python to gain insights into customer preferences, restaurant types, and service modes. Various visualizations and statistical techniques were used to extract meaningful patterns and solve key business questions related to Zomato's operations.

## Objectives
The project aims to solve the following questions:
1. What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
2. How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
3. What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
4. What is the average spending of couples who mostly order food online?
5. Which mode (online or offline) has the maximum rating?
6. Which type of restaurants received more offline orders, so that Zomato can provide some good offers?

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Zomato dataset was collected and cleaned for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Various plots were used for visualization, such as bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
   - Data was analyzed for trends, patterns, and insights.
3. **Visualization:**
   - Seaborn and Matplotlib were used to create insightful visualizations.

## Results and Insights
- Identified the most preferred types of restaurants among customers.
- Analyzed customer votes and average ratings for different restaurants.
- Explored spending patterns of couples ordering food online.
- Compared ratings between online and offline service modes.
- Identified restaurant types receiving higher offline orders.
